# ENSC350-RISC_Processor
VHDL design of a RISC processor architecture

## Description
This reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processor architecture is based on the Harvard memory model, meaning that it has seperate and independant access to data and instruction memory.

## Parametric Design
The bus widths for the processor are designed to be parametric in the code, and are defined in the package. This is currently using 20-bit instructions, with 16-bit data, and 16 registers.
